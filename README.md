Password Strength Evaluation Report
Objective:
Understand the characteristics of strong passwords by creating and testing them using online strength-checking tools, then analyze and summarize findings.

 Create Multiple Passwords

Password	Description
password123:	Simple, common password with lowercase and numbers
Password123:	Added uppercase for slight complexity
Passw0rd!23:	Substituted letter with number, added symbol
G7$t&Bp@94x!:	Complex with mix of upper, lower, symbols, numbers
R2#tYq9@Xm5!v:	Long and randomized

 Test Each Password

Password	Strength Score	Feedback
password123:	18% (Very Weak)	Too common, predictable, lacks symbols
Password123:	28% (Weak)	Slightly better due to uppercase, but still predictable
Passw0rd!23:	64% (Moderate)	Good use of substitution and symbol
G7$t&Bp@94x!:	100% (Strong)	Excellent complexity, variety, and length
R2#tYq9@Xm5!v:	100% (Strong)	Very strong, difficult to guess, ideal structure

 Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
Based on testing and tool feedback:

Use at least 12–14 characters.

Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.

Avoid using dictionary words or personal information.

Use unpredictable patterns and random sequences.

Avoid reusing passwords across sites.

Consider using a password manager for complex passwords.

 Common Password Attacks
Attack Type	Description	Defense
Brute Force	Systematically tries all combinations	Long, complex passwords increase time to crack
Dictionary Attack	Uses a list of common words/passwords	Avoid real words, use random sequences
Phishing	Tricks users into revealing passwords	Don't click unknown links, enable 2FA
Credential Stuffing	Tries known credentials from data leaks	Don’t reuse passwords

 Summary - How Complexity Affects Security
Password complexity plays a critical role in preventing unauthorized access. Longer passwords with a mix of character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols) significantly increase the time and effort required for brute force or dictionary attacks. Simple passwords like "password123" can be cracked in seconds, while complex ones like G7$t&Bp@94x! may take years even with advanced computing.

Final Tips for Strong Passwords
Use passphrases or random strings.

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible.

Change passwords regularly, especially if a breach is suspected.

Store passwords securely (use password managers like Bitwarden or LastPass).
